# Character Creation

## 1. Choose a Heritage

Heritages establish a character’s base Health.

## 2. Select a Lineage from your Heritage

Lineage provides a single Trained Talent, some common physical features, a cultural identity and suggested background details for characters.

## 3. Choose an Archetype

Archetype provides guidelines for a character’s role in the game setting.

An Archetype applies a modifier to the character's Health, specifies access to certain Armor Types, grants a Save Modifier and a second Trained Talent. Archetypes can also grant a defining attribute to further define their role in a setting.

## 4. Train 4 more Talents

These Talents are in addition to the Lineage and Archetype Talents granted earlier.

Players can choose up to four individual Talents to Train and further customize their character. This is where having a character concept is helpful as you select Talents to rely on while adventuring.

At Generation, Talents cannot be Focused.

## 5. Background

Take some time to craft a well rounded background for your beginning adventurer.

* What is your character concept? 
* Where did they come from? 
* How were they raised? 
* What do they value?
* Does or did their family have a trade? 
* Were they apprenticed to someone to learn a trade themselves?
* Does the character carry beliefs from their family? 
* What is their moral grounding in this chaotic world?
