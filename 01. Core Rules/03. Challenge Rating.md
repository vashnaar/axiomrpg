# Challenge Rating
Not all tasks require a Challenge Rating. It is at the discretion of the Game Master to determine if a task is difficult enough to warrant a dice roll to complete.

Remember, role playing is cooperative storytelling, sometimes mundane details can be role-played or safely ignored if there is no danger in a character failing at the task.

## What's the Challenge Rating?

Challenge Ratings are ultimately up to the game master to establish but we do provide ways to quickly derive a base Challenge Rating for tasks. This system effectively scales the difficulty of a task to the capabilities of the character.

1. What Talent is appropriate for the task?
2. What is the character's Dice Pool with this Talent?

* Untrained, 1d6, provides a base Challenge Rating of 3
* Trained, 2d6, provides a Base Challenge Rating of 6
* Focused, 3d6, provides a Base Challenge Rating of 9

## Challenge Rating Modifier

Challenge Rating Modifiers, typically referred to as a **Penalty**, increase the difficulty to complete a task. Just like Dice Pool Modifiers, these are based on the number of dice rolled to apply the Penalty.

* Magical Banes usually manifest as a Penalty to complete a task or take an action.
* Defense increases the Challenge Rating to successfully strike an opponent during combat.

The maximum Penalty is +5.
